TODO List for Epiar 1.0
=======================

Immediate Future
----------------
* Finished Archive work moving data into data.tgz, allowing for real filesystem to override .tgz files given a setting in a XML file (Chris Thielen)
* Implemet XPath-esque support for Options, perhaps redesigning that class a little for XPath's newer, broader scope (Chris Thielen)
* Implement the UI (eUI, "ew-wee")
* Implement a general Lua interface (Chris Walton)

Before the next release (version 0.7.0)
---------------------------------------
* Engine/game split
* Basic network game support including master epiar.net server
* Sound
* Landing dialog
* AI
* Editor (features up to match Epiar 0.7.0)
* A medium-sized universe w/ good traffic, items to buy, enough to play for a while at least
* Updates dialog that polls epiar.net to see if there's a new version to download
* Some basic scenarios up in the epiar.net community gallery to download (in-game community.epiar.net browsing)

The Rest (for version 1.0)
--------------------------
