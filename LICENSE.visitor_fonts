I found your bitmap font, "Visitor", on dafont.com and would like to distribute it as part of my free, open source computer game, Epiar (www.epiar.net, screenshot: http://sourceforge.net/dbimage.php?id=125162 . There is no money involved and the game will always be free. Do I have your permission to distribute it freely with the game?

In the spirit of freeware, which is explicitly permitted under the original terms, as well as with Brian Kent's permission for distribution, it is safe to package this font with any repository RPMs, DEBs, etc. so long as it stays with the Epiar package.

If you would like to simply include the Visitor font in your own game or font package, please see the original terms above and contact Brian Kent.

If the nebulous quality of this license has prevented from distributing Epiar, please contact Chris Thielen at chris@epiar.net to arrange for the font's removal and replacement by a similar bitmap font.
